== Configuration Management

In the small, all is well. On the Cloud, oh the horror!

=== Problems

* Eliminate the need to rebuild image when infrastructure changes
* Use configuration for dependency injection
* Keep out parts of the configuration that prevent the image to be
  reused for instantiating multiple nodes
* Keep secret keys out of the git
* Keep secret keys out of the built image
* Pass configuration upon start of the instance

Stuff that is out of scope:

* Make changes in configuration
** How to publish e.g. the endpoint of our service to consumers and
   the fact that it is ready to use.
* Communication of running nodes between each other
** Handle with zookeeper, consul or etcd
* Reflect changes in the configuration
** By watching or getting notified of change and implementing
   complicated and error prone logic to reconfigure running instance
** By restarting whole instance. Who restarts the server?
* Who sets up the external configuration
* Who provisions the servers

=== Approach

Follow http://12factor.net/config[The Twelve Factors].

Configuration is static. When the config changes, service is
restarted. Design choice is to have stateless fail-fast services,
that have their configuration stored on various places.

* in a config files inside classpath. Support should be for `json`,
  `edn` and `clj` files. By definition, name of such configuration
  file is `config.xxx`
* in environment variables
* in system properties passed to the JVM
* as a part of a build script, e.g. somewhere in lein
** either in profiles.clj or in project.clj
** TODO analyze this more
** good for dev and test to keep secrets out 
* external url, e.g. s3 object
** good for secrets and for prod

Configuration can contain information on which module to load.
This enables dependency injection.
The module loading logic is implemented by the application.

Technologies:

* https://github.com/weavejester/environ[environ] for the access to
  environment and system properties.
** Environ is simple and OK to use
* https://github.com/sonian/carica[carica] for managing configuration
  scattered through classpath
** Tried carica, it is a mess!
* ad hoc loading of external config files, with a simple slurp
** idea is that config is stored inside VPC, and access to it is
restricted by the cloud configuration, and available only from the
inside of the VPC. Whoever configures the cloud sets the configuration
and also starts instances in a correct order.
* tweaks
** convert env & lein-env -  JAVA_HOME to {:java {:home}}
** convert sysprop - java.home {:java {:home}}
** (get-in conf [:java :home] 'default)
** TODO: handle types? (envs are string only)
