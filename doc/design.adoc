== Design

Using functional programming, immutable data and loose
coupling. We want to be agile, avoid incidental complexity and
unnecessary bureaucracy. We want simple architecture, manageable by
a small team. Refactoring and prototyping will happen often, and
requirements will change. We want to spend little time on things
that may be no longer needed week later.

We want to be able to have dev, testing and prod profiles. We will
use testing, but as we are using functional programming and Clojure,
we hope that mocking/stubs and integration testing will not take
long time to prepare. We want to have low maintenance overhead and
keep app's TCO low. We are deploying on a cloud, but we should not be
tied to a specific provider.

=== Server

By design, we have a stateless server that can fail fast.
Image is built once and is used to instantiate multiple nodes in a
load balancer. We are using JVM and Clojure.

=== Client
